<p>This calculator project is a product of day 32 of the 6-month web development boot camp I am taking and, simultaneously, day 7 of the introduction to Typescript. 
<br/>
I am proud of my ability to find solutions and having programmed this calculator as a result. ðŸŒˆ</p>

## Design

The playful, colourful design for this web calculator was inspired by both the flat, angular design of <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/12909522--dailyui-Mortgage-Calculator" title="Sebastian Vigil - Mortgage Calculator">Sebastian Vigil's "Mortgage Calculator"</a>, as well as its vibrant blue, and the layout and colour assortment of <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/15359416-MechaCalc-Calculator-App" title="Afrills - MechaCalc - Calculator App">Afrills' "MechaCalc - Calculator App"</a>. This combination makes for a modern look while 
ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing user experience.
